NOTE
Link to the HackerRank practice excersize:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400 line:95%
The page reads: "Learning C is fun!"

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400 line:95%
Let's practise!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.500 line:95%
Here's a fun exercise called <i>Querying the Document</i>.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.200 line:95%
The objective of this exercise is to translate the

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.900 line:95%
highlighted character string into a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.500 line:95%
data structure from which I may easily query the text.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.700 line:95%
Here's my solution.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.100 line:95%
Let's execute it.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500 line:95%
Insert profanity here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:95%
The page reads: "Learning C is fun! ...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000 line:95%
... Said no one ... ever!!"
